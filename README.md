# Open Chromatin Region Study of Liver and Pancreas

## Introduction
This is a project for the course 03713: Bioinformatics Data Integration Practicum from Carnegie Mellon University, with purpose of analyzing open chromatin regions across species of human and mouse. The project aims to evaluate the extent of conservation of involved regulatory elements across species and tissues, and to understand how these conserved regions may influence tissue-specific gene regulation. 

## Workflow


## Tools
- HALPER (https://github.com/pfenninglab/halLiftover-postprocessing)
- bedtools (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- GREAT (https://great.stanford.edu/great/public/html/)
- MEME Suite (https://meme-suite.org/meme/)

## Datasets
The original narrowpeak datasets for alternate adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas tissues were provided as results of ATAC-Seq, along with their QC reports, from the project pathway of bridges2. These are also available under the data folder in the repository, along with respective QC reports that helped us conclude to leave out the alternative adrenal gland data in aim of using the two tissue data with best integrity and quality for the project.
